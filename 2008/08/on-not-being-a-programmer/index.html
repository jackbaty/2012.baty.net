<div class="entry-content"><p>I used to be a programmer.</p>

<p>For years I&#8217;d sit at some computer or another hacking away at whatever was interesting or required at the time. It&#8217;s all I did. I may not have been a Rock Star(tm) or Ninja(tm), but I built stuff that worked and that clients liked. A lot of it.</p>

<p>When development was all I did, there were things that were critically important to me. Languages. Frameworks. Source control. Those sorts of things.</p>

<p>But these days I don&#8217;t do much development. At &#8220;Fusionary&#8221;:http://fusionary.com we have plenty of developers and builders who are smarter, faster and more clever than I&#8217;ve ever been. My job now is to make sure projects get done, using the appropriate tools, on time and on budget.</p>

<p>I have a lot to learn.</p>

<p>The first thing I learned since not being a programmer was that the critically important things &#8211; aren&#8217;t. For example&#8230;</p>

<p>h3. Frameworks</p>

<p>I love Rails. Once I started learning Ruby nothing else mattered. We shipped our first production ecommerce site built with Rails before Rails 1.0 was even released. And this was after 40% of it had already been built using PHP. It turns out to have been a good decision. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d make the same one today.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that happy programmers are more productive. What I no longer believe is that there is One True Language/Framework that makes all programmers happy. We just launched a couple of sites built with &#8220;CodeIgniter&#8221;:http://codeigniter.com/ and the guys working on it had a ball. It was built quickly, professionally and with no whining about namespaces or inconsistent method names or anything. They just built it. The only thing I noticed was that it was easy to deploy and just worked when doing so. I did miss migrations, but other than that it made no difference to me. That was a surprise. You can build great apps using <em>any</em> framework/language. And don&#8217;t give me that crap about the poor PHP or .NET guys not knowing what they&#8217;re missing. They do, and they don&#8217;t. That surprised me too.</p>

<p>h3. Agile Development</p>

<p>Agile development methods work. Or so I&#8217;m told. As a developer, they make perfect sense. User Stories, short iterations, code reviews, etc all work great and I understand the value. The problem isn&#8217;t in working Agile, it&#8217;s <em>selling</em> Agile then living with it. I have yet to run into a client who doesn&#8217;t understand the concepts. They seem to love it. I just can&#8217;t seem to figure how to execute once they disappear from the process, only to return every week or two with input on things we&#8217;ve already implemented without them. And without someone acting as a Proxy for the client who knows <em>exactly</em> what we&#8217;re building, it&#8217;s back to educated guesses and biweekly demo meetings.</p>

<p>I imagine that I&#8217;ll get better at all of this, but right now I&#8217;m finding the transition from programmer to manager to be more challenging that I expected. I&#8217;ll buy some books, make some mistakes, and keep you posted.</p>
