  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a member of Netflix since sometime in 2002 and they&#8217;ve been good to me. The thought of switching to Blockbuster&#8217;s (or anyone else&#8217;s) version of movie-rental-via-internet never crossed my mind, and still hasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The problem with Netflix (and similar services) is lack of spontaneity. Quite often I know which movie I want to see <em>tonight</em>, and of course I don&#8217;t have it and it&#8217;s not even in my queue. Inevitably, I run to the local Blockbuster and rent it. And (also inevitably), I end up paying 4 or 5 dollars in late fees.</p>

<p>Blockbuster now has a program <em>in the stores</em> that changes things. For $24.95/month, I can have any 2 movies out at a time, with no late fees or due dates. When I want another movie (or two), I just go exchange the movies I have out for new ones. I can do that as many times as I want.</p>

<p>When I inquired about this service, the girl behind the counter said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a look here at your account and…&#8221; Her eyes widened in disbelief, &#8220;&#8230;Oh dear, you&#8217;ll definitely save money this way!&#8221; Apparently she had spotted my late fee totals for the past few months.</p>

<p>So, I signed up, grabbed a couple movies and went home. I suddenly can&#8217;t wait to decide what I want to watch tonight.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like Netflix without the lag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago during a basketball tournament, Jessica asked me to quickly braid her hair before the game. It happened so fast I almost forgot to notice. She just asked me again. This time I didn&#8217;t forget to notice.</p>

<p>This time I savored every single moment of it.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I would braid her hair each morning before school. &#8220;There&#8217;s BUMPS in it!&#8221; she&#8217;d scream, yanking out the hair tie in a huff. I&#8217;d say that it looked fine, and quickly redo it, sending her off to school. We both hated it, but we sat through it each day anyway. Just part of the process.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s 15 now and that process is long gone.</p>

<p>But there she sat, on the floor in front of me. Hair tie on her wrist &#8211; waiting. I fumbled around, making sure to get the 3 sections even so it wouldn&#8217;t end up all lopsided. When I got to the end (That last bit is tricky), she handed me the tie and I did that wrap-loop-wrap action to get it nice and snug. She said &#8220;Thanks!&#8221; got up, walked away and showed her friend Robin. It was almost as if she were bragging.</p>

<p>And she didn&#8217;t complain at all about the bumps.</p>

<p>He doesn&#8217;t really need content anymore. Im happy to just sit and play with the balloon all day.</p>

<p>Elvis and JFK didn&#8217;t die, they live in a Nursing home somewhere in Texas. This particular nursing home also happens to be haunted by an ancient Egyption mummy who&#8217;s sucking the souls from the residents. Who but The King and The Pres could possibly be capable of stopping it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bizarre, funny, corny and even touching.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scene One</strong>: Two kids and an annoying CG critter who squeaks nothing but the word &#8220;precious&#8221; walk around on rocks and argue over which one of them is the bad guy.</p>

<p><strong>Scene Two</strong>: A huge battle sequence between two armies of unknown origin.</p>

<p>Alternate between those two scenes for three hours.</p>

<p>Then, show a few kids, aka &#8220;hobbits&#8221; jumping up and down on a bed and then going home to their little Dr. Suess houses.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After seeing <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Spartan-1130353/">Spartan</a>, it occurred to me that the problem I have with many of Mamet&#8217;s films is that although there&#8217;s plenty of interesting dialog, there are no real characters. I couldn&#8217;t have cared less about anyone in the movie. Even the cleverest dialog will have trouble compensating for that.</p>

<p>Roger Ebert (yes <em>that</em> Roger Ebert) and I typically like the same movies, believe it or not. Not in this case, however. He loved the film. He also thought it was one of Kilmer&#8217;s best performances. Bah. Kilmer was monotonous and dull, and I don&#8217;t think it was intentional. Willam Macy, one of my favorites and a Mamet regular, was completely wasted in this film. They could&#8217;ve used anyone for that role. Ah well, guess I&#8217;ll watch <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/HouseofGames-1010021/">House of Games</a> again so I can forget Spartan.</p>

<p>(<em>I would&#8217;ve linked to the IMDB page for the movie, but it seems one of the ad servers was down, so none of the pages would load. Hate that.</em>)</p>
