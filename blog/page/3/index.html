<p>I love this photo. It&#8217;s from a set of early 1900s negatives I picked up at a garage sale. The expression on the man&#8217;s face makes me smile every time I look at it. I like it so much in fact that I&#8217;ve made it my new avatar.</p>

<p>Looking through old photos is something I never tire of. What I find sad is that everyone in this set of photos is almost certainly dead now. I&#8217;ve not been able to determine who these people are, but I would love to find their children or grandchildren and return the negatives to them. Not everyone cares as much about this sort of thing as I do, but c&#8217;mon, who wouldn&#8217;t love to suddenly find a couple hundred lost photos of their great grandparents?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone asked me about a photo that I&#8217;d scanned a couple years ago, so I went into my Lightroom library to dig it up. I couldn&#8217;t find it. Many of the other scans from that same batch of found negatives were there, but a number of them seemed to have gone missing. I thought making things digital was supposed to make it <em>easier</em> to store and find things. Apparently, I&#8217;ve not figured out how to do that yet, so I pulled the original negatives and found the ones I wanted in about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>While they were out I scanned a few more that I missed or otherwise skipped last time. I find them fascinating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why is it that someone referring to a new company as a &#8220;Startup&#8221; sets me on edge? Wikipedia describes startups like this, &#8220;A startup company or startup is a company with a limited operating history.&#8221;<a href="[Startup">^wikipedia</a>, which is a totally fair description, so that&#8217;s not it. I know people at these companies, and for the most part they are smart and driven and doing awesome things. That&#8217;s not it either.</p>

<p>The problem may be one of association. When someone (with some redundancy) says &#8220;it&#8217;s a new startup&#8221; I want to roll my eyes and grimace in anticipation of the rest of the conversation, which will probably include things like &#8220;pivot&#8221; and &#8220;serial entrepreneur&#8221; and &#8220;investor&#8221; and so on. Most of these strike me as nice ways of saying &#8220;we&#8217;re just throwing shit at the wall hoping to cash out as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure when I started feeling this way, but it&#8217;s proving hard to shake.</p>

<time datetime="2012-01-15T08:25:27-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 15<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a fun discussion going on around how the iPhone handles the &#8220;Ring/Silent&#8221; switch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/01/14/mute">Marco on the iPhone&#8217;s Mute behavior</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The user told the iPhone to make noise by either scheduling an alarm or initiating an obviously noise-playing feature in an app.</p>

<p>The user also told the iPhone to be silent with the switch on the side.</p>

<p>The user has issued conflicting commands, and the iPhone can’t obey both.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Marco is right that it can&#8217;t obey both, so I would like it to obey the command I issued <em>last</em>. That means when I say &#8220;shut up&#8221; I mean to shut <em>everything</em> up until I say otherwise. It means I don&#8217;t want my phone to make any noise at all. I almost always use that switch to avoid disturbing other people. Those people don&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) care if that sudden noise resulted &#8220;from user actions that are solely and explicitly intended to produce sound.&#8221; They only know some doofus forgot to turn off his phone and it&#8217;s ruining the performance. I don&#8217;t want to be that doofus just because I&#8217;d forgotten that I&#8217;d done something or other in some app hours or days before.</p>

<p>When I used to have a regular alarm clock, I had to reset it each night before bed. That was normal. If I forgot and overslept it was my fault. I feel the same about my phone. If I tell it to not make noise, it shouldn&#8217;t make <em>any</em> noise. If that makes the iPhone less useful as an alarm clock, I&#8217;ll just get a proper clock.</p>

<p>Marco <a href="http://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/158434064792162305">points out later</a> on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p>That almost nobody has really talked about the iPhone&#8217;s mute policy in its 4.5 years suggests that Apple probably made the right choice.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a good point, but I still disagree with with Apple&#8217;s choice.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I&#8217;m with <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2012/01/15/unmuting-on-the-mute-question/">Ihnatko</a> on this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thought I&#8217;d post a quick list of my favorite gadgets and other things from last year, in no particular order.</p>

<h2>Sonos Wireless HiFi System</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2012/01/sonos-s5-black.jpg" alt="Sonos s5 black" /></p>

<p>Man I love my Sonos. I brought home 2 of the CONNECT devices and one PLAY:5. Within 20 minutes I was streaming all of my music to existing stereos in my home office and living room and the PLAY:5 was rocking the bedroom. So easy. Apple doesn&#8217;t have a monopoly on things Just Working. In fact, I replaced the Airport Express/Airfoil system I had been using and found the Sonos better in almost every way. The PLAY:5 sounds absolutely great, and I can easily carry it from by bedroom to the darkroom by unplugging the power and grabbing the handle. It&#8217;s almost perfect, and combined with <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> and <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> I have an unending supply of music streaming wirelessly throughout my house with nearly no effort at all.</p>

<p>Absolutely recommended.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sonos.com/">http://www.sonos.com/</a></p>

<h2>Fuji X100</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2012/01/x100.jpg" alt="X100" /></p>

<p>I bought a few cameras this year, and all of them are great, but it&#8217;s the X100 that really stands out. Compact, APS-C sensor, physical controls for the important things, and a great 35mm (equivalent) lens. The optical (hybrid) viewfinder is pretty great. And the camera is simply gorgeous. For digital, it&#8217;s the only camera I&#8217;ve been using.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag;=jackbaty-20&amp;linkCode;=as2&amp;camp;=1789&amp;creative;=390957&amp;creativeASIN;=B0043RS864">Fujifilm X100</a> (Amazon link)</p>

<h2>Breville Juicer</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2012/01/breville-juicer.jpg" alt="Breville juicer" /></p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing helped me eat healthier last year it&#8217;s the Breville Juicer (800JEXL). It&#8217;s well-made, looks good, and makes short work of juicing just about anything.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VAFVG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag;=jacbatsay-20&amp;linkCode;=as2&amp;camp;=1789&amp;creative;=390957&amp;creativeASIN;=B0002VAFVG">Breville Juicer</a> (Amazon link)</p>

<h2>Maxwell Scott Briefcase</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2012/01/lorenzo.jpg" alt="Lorenzo" /></p>

<p>I love bags. I may love them <a href="http://jackbaty.com/2011/12/bag-problem/">too much</a>. Last year I wanted something small and thin I could carry to the office every day with just the 11&#8221; MacBook Air, iPad, Notebook, and some odds and ends. The &#8220;Lorenzo&#8221; from Maxwell Scott fit the bill nicely. Handmade using really great leather. Great small bag.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.maxwellscottbags.com/business/leather-briefcases/slim-leather-briefcase.html">http://www.maxwellscottbags.com/</a></p>

<h2>PersonalBrain</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2012/01/pb-screenshot.jpg" alt="Pb screenshot" />
http://download.cnet.com/PersonalBrain/3004-2074_4-10877378.html</p>

<p>While not technically &#8220;gear,&#8221; I wanted to mention my favorite new app of 2011. I&#8217;ve tried PersonalBrain before (it&#8217;s been around forever), but only this past year did I give it a <a href="http://jackbaty.com/2011/06/personalbrain/">serious go</a>. It&#8217;s a Java app, the UI is funky and somewhat overwrought, and it&#8217;s expensive, but what it does it does wonderfully. I use it to manage people, links between them and the things they do, track project ideas and relationships, you name it. Browsing the &#8220;Plex&#8221; frequently leads to spotting relationships and links between ideas I may not have stumbled onto otherwise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thebrain.com/">http://www.thebrain.com/</a></p>

<p>That&#8217;s all I can think of right now. Overall, a pretty good year, gadget-wise.</p>

<p>I like people who are bullish, which makes me like James Altucher even more.
