  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I wrote last year about the first things I install on a new computer I forgot what seems now to be another important list&#8230; the things I don&#8217;t install on a new computer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/appzapper-icon-20090324-213045.jpg" alt="appzapper-icon" /></p>

<p>Appzapper Icon by Jasper Hauser</p>

<p><strong>Things</strong> - I&#8217;m a GTD junkie and I thought Things was like the second coming of David Allen. I just find that, as tweaky and addled with features as it is, OmniFocus still wins.</p>

<p><strong>Textmate</strong> - This one surprised me. I switched to Textmate early on, and like many developers, found it to be a flexible, refreshing change from whatever it was we were using previously. We got along just fine for quite a while. As I started doing less programming and more text editing and manipulation, I became less fond of the way Textmate went about things. Multi-file search is horrible. Character based undo is still the dumbest idea ever. Large files are not handled well. And so on. I&#8217;m also getting lazy, and I don&#8217;t want to keep everything my editor is capable of wedged in my head. I went back to BBEdit, where there are palettes and menus and icons all right there in plain sight. Seriously, if you try the multi-file search in BBEdit you&#8217;ll wonder how Textmate ever became so popular. I even like the ridiculous HTML palette.</p>

<p><strong>LaTeX</strong> - It turns out that no matter how badly I want to need LaTeX for something, it just never comes up. I just don&#8217;t see myself writing a long academic paper with all sorts of end notes, references and complex math formulas. It&#8217;s just not worth the effort.</p>

<p><strong>Quicksilver</strong> - Sorry, but LaunchBar is faster, simpler, and more stable than Quicksilver ever was.</p>

<p><strong>MacVim</strong> - I&#8217;m a Vim lover from way back, and I still do a ton of quick editing in it, but there&#8217;s no longer a need for the full Mac-lovin&#8217; version of it.</p>

<p><strong>Aperture</strong> - Tried it, liked it, but Lightroom has all the momentum, resources and extras I&#8217;ll ever need for photo management.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop</strong> - I&#8217;ve always hated it. Now that Lightroom has local adjustments, and the Nik plugins are being developed for it, I just don&#8217;t need Photoshop.</p>

<p><strong>Most of the Everything Buckets</strong> - I&#8217;ve left behind Curio, Journler, Notebook, Together, EagleFiler, Evernote  and so on. My life is now in Tinderbox, Yojimbo and DEVONthink.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there are more, but these are the things that at one time I felt I needed on a daily basis. Times change.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Watches are cool, but wearing a wristwatch seems to have fallen a bit out of fashion. I can understand why, since many of us are either sitting in front of a computer all day or are within arm&#8217;s reach of a cell phone and either can tell me what time it is. There are some occasions though in which just a quick glance at my wrist is faster and less annoying, so I decided it was time for a new watch.</p>

<p>I wore a watch for years. I can remember receiving my first digital watch as a birthday gift  when I was quite young. I&#8217;m talking about the Pulsar with bright red LED numbers. After the Pulsar I went through a Timex and some other cheap digitals no one remembers. When my grandfather died he left me his retirement watch, which I wore for a few years. It&#8217;s a fine watch, but the face has yellowed with age it has become too hard to read.</p>

<p>I understand that good watches are expensive, but I had no idea how expensive. For example, I kind of like the <a href="http://www.patek.com/patek-philippe.html?pageId=44275&amp;backgroundId">Patek Philippe 5070</a> but at nearly $70,000 I&#8217;ll have to pass. What I wanted was a quality, fully mechanical watch that was just good enough to call a &#8220;timepiece.&#8221; It&#8217;s the &#8220;fully mechanical&#8221; part that gets you, but the idea of wearing a watch comprised of about a zillion finely-tuned springs and gears all working together is more interesting to me than something with a battery-powered Quartz movement on a computer chip. Besides, I&#8217;m on a bit of a no-battery kick these days anyway.</p>

<p>Long story short, I settled on a <a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/the-collection/aquaracer/man/automatic-watch/index.lbl?w=WAF2010.BA0818">Tag Heuer Aquaracer Automatic</a>. Not ridiculously expensive, looks nice and should last a lifetime. Oh, and it&#8217;s good in the water to 300m. That should come in handy.</p>
