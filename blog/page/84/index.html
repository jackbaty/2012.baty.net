  <div class="entry-content"><p>Turns out that there are some avid Stanley Kubrick fans at <a href="http://www.fusionary.com/">the office</a>. <a href="http://www.masuga.com/">Ryan</a> has seen every movie (but one) that he&#8217;s ever directed. <a href="http://www.freshdan.com">Dan</a> hadn&#8217;t seen The Shining, and rented it after hearing our reviews during lunch. He&#8217;s been raving about it ever since and already knows more about it than most.</p>

<p>Due in March, <a href="http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/books/film/work/facts/00301.htm">The Stanley Kubrick Archives</a> looks like a great book. At $200, I&#8217;m going to taking donations at work in order to buy it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re doing some database maintenance. <del>It will be back online within 30 minutes.</del></p>

<p>UPDATE1: Unless it takes longer, in which case it won&#8217;t be back online within 30 minutes, but rather will be back online after a longer period of time (greater number of minutes).&#8221;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I may be taking this simpler-is-better thing a bit too far. <a href="http://jackbaty.com/2005/01/16/simple-is-better/">Earlier</a> I looked at software development, cameras, computers and writing. Now I&#8217;ve begun evaluating my workflow and the software I use to  get things done. For example, I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> to manage email for a very long time. It can be configured to do just about anything and there&#8217;s really nothing faster for tearing through mailing lists. Its behaviour can be tweaked to do amazingly geeky and wonderful things. Wonderful that is, only after screwing with the .muttrc file for hours getting it there. Also,  I use it via SSH on the mail server. This means no inline images, attachments are a 3-step process, filing messages needs to be done based on a mental map of the server filing system. Links must be copied via clipboard to a browser since there&#8217;s no way to simply click them and have it happen automatically (without even <em>more</em> .muttrc tweaking). And editing messages in <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> is great, when I&#8217;m in the mood for VIM that is.</p>

<p>Speaking of VIM, I&#8217;ve been doing most of my code editing using GVIM on OS X. VIM rocks, no doubt about it. Like Mutt, it can be configured to perform magic using just a few keystrokes. A few barely memorized, arcane and complex keystrokes, that is. Also, as with Mutt, I&#8217;ve spent a large portion of my life futzing with the .vimrc file and various plugins and key mappings. I realized today while trying to <strong>just get some work done</strong> that too much of my brain is preoccupied with the intricacies of the development <em>enviroment</em> while the rest actually works on development. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the tool can sing and dance if it&#8217;s singing the wrong tune. I want to free up the parts of my brain that are too often processing and remembering configuration options and channel them into more productive things.</p>

<p>In my efforts to become more productive, I may have passed the point of diminishing returns. As an experiment, I&#8217;m going to dial down the complexity until essential functionality starts falling off, then stop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While using Textpattern for this site I started work on a plugin for displaying Flickr photos. I never got past the proof of concept phase, and moved to Wordpress before having a chance to finish it. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have to recreate it here, since <a href="http://www.worrad.com/archives/2004/11/30/flickr-gallery-wp-plugin/">this fine plugin</a> seems to work lovely.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve created a Wordpress &#8220;static&#8221; page template and tossed a call to the plugin at my new <a href="http://jackbaty.com/flickr/">/flickr/</a> page</p>

<p>That will do just fine for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Saturday evening shortly after midnight I was mindlessly browsing around when I ran across the <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrick template</a> for <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. I liked it so much I decided to use it for my own little &#8216;blog. At the same time I figured I&#8217;d update Wordpress to the latest nightly build. 3 hours later I was realizing what a terrifically bad idea that was. Repeat after me: never, <em>ever</em> change more than one thing at a time! Anyhoo, I ended up finally getting everything working and all was well. Just one more little tweak andâ€¦ wait a minute!â€¦ the default Wordpress template looks suspiciously like the one I&#8217;d just spent all night working on. Then, a few minutes later, I read this on the Presentation page of the Wordpress admin:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The default WordPress theme based on the famous Kubrick.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Great, not only did I just waste an entire evening farting around with a template that I already <em>had</em>, but over the next few weeks <strong>everyone&#8217;s</strong> weblog is going to look exactly like mine. Time to focus on that blue bit up there I suppose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3459051">Apparently</a>, the 7 people on the planet who care deeply about podcasting are complaining that the iPod Shuffle isn&#8217;t suited for it. Good lord. Who cares? There are two reasons for not caring. First, podcasting is silly. Have you ever actually listened to a podcast? They&#8217;re almost universally useless, mainly because podcasters only talk about podcasting. That&#8217;s a very boring closed-loop-incest-fest if you ask me. And second, Apple makes plenty of iPods that <strong>are</strong> useful for listening to podcasts. Buy one of those instead.</p>

<p>Who said that every device Apple makes has to confirm to every niche usage pattern? No one, that&#8217;s who.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A favorite quote by someone I&#8217;ve forgotten is &#8220;Do not mistake complexity for sophistication.&#8221; This continues to be good advice. I&#8217;ve been tricked into complexity many times. It sneaks its way into everything&#8211;software, consumer devices, even the written word. I&#8217;m going to get rid of it in as many places as I can.</p>

<p><strong>Software</strong> - I develop a boatload of minor, and some not so minor, web applications. The urge is <em>always</em> there to put in a ton of cool features that absolutely nobody is going to want or use. From now on I&#8217;m living by the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">You ain&#8217;t gonna need it</a> principle: &#8220;Always implement things when you <strong>actually</strong> need them, never when you just <strong>foresee</strong> that you need them.&#8221; Now, how to get clients to think like that?</p>

<p><strong>Cameras</strong> - I have two cameras. (That&#8217;s not entirely true, but for the sake of argumentâ€¦) One is a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/galleries/essays/072000.htm">Leica M6 TTL</a> and the other is a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos20d/">Canon 20D</a>. Both are awesome, but I seem to grab the Leica first. There are really only 3 things that need changing on a camera: Aperture, shutter speed and focus. Most of these are automatic on the Canon, but when something <em>needs</em> changing it&#8217;s a much more complex operation  involving menus and LCD readouts and such. On the other hand, the Leica has only 3 main controls. Guess what they do.</p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong> - It seems that Apple is thinking along the same lines. The new Mac Mini and iPod Shuffle are about as simple as devices of their types get. I don&#8217;t think the appeal of these new offerings is completely about price. I want one of each, even though I currently use each of their more complex siblings.</p>

<p><strong>Writing</strong> - I just can&#8217;t seem to stop tossing in unnecessary words and run-on sentences. Still working on that. For now you&#8217;ll just need to wade through it all on the off chance there&#8217;s something useful buried somewhere.</p>
