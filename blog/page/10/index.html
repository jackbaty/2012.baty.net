  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few of you started talking about <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> again recently and it made me want to clean up my own neglected configuration.

<p>After much mucking about with my .vimrc file, I&#8217;ve gotten it to a state I&#8217;m fairly happy with. I deleted years of cruft and only left in the things I really use, plus a few nice additions discovered while Googling about.</p>

<p>The combination of installing new plugins, tweaking .vimrc, and using latest <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> has reminded me how great text editing can be. I&#8217;ve retained the muscle memory from using Vim for years, which really helps. I enjoy using BBEdit, but some power editing in Vim makes me feel extra nerdy - in a good way.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I just discovered that <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor">QuickCursor</a> works with MacVim as well, which is totally handy.</p>

<p><a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> is a recent entry in the personal journaling camp. It&#8217;s simple, looks great, and doesn&#8217;t try to do <em>everything</em>. What it does do is encourage you to write. It does this by being beautiful, making everything easy, and by displaying regular reminders. At first I found the reminders that pop up from the menu bar to be a nuisance. Eventually, I started typing a quick sentence or two each time and that has led to writing a greater number of entries than I would if left to my own devices. If you don&#8217;t like the reminders, you can turn them off. Same with the &#8220;inspirational&#8221; quotes feature. I can live without those.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m using Day One like a personal Twitter. That is, most entries happen throughout the day in short bursts. This is the opposite of how I use my beloved paper journal. With that, I sit down deliberately and write for longer periods a few times a week. So there&#8217;s no danger of abandoning paper altogether, but with Day One I can supplement it nicely.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Day One every day for 32 days and have written entries on all but 4 of them. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s working. The first release does not include search or export&#8211;both critical features for me&#8211;and both are slated for inclusion &#8220;over the next several months,&#8221; so I&#8217;ll be sticking with it.</p>

<p>There is also a version for the iPhone. I don&#8217;t like writing on the iPhone, but with easy-as-pie DropBox integration, I use it anyway.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <a href="http://journler.com/features/screenshots/index.php">Journler</a> or current <a href="http://www.momentoapp.com/">Momento</a> for iPhone user, Day One might be a little light on features for you. For those of us just wanting to simply and easily jot a few daily notes, Day One is close to perfect.</p>

<time datetime="2011-04-02T10:36:03-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 2<span>nd</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll pass on investing in your idea to create a better stylus for the iPad, thanks. Stylus input on iPads will <em>always</em> suck. &#8211;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jackbaty/status/52506788595113984">me, on twitter</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can tell from my tweet above, I&#8217;ve dismissed the idea of using a stylus on my iPad. Writing notes during meetings was my justification for buying the iPad in the first place. Doesn&#8217;t work. Probably never will. I&#8217;ve tried every app, stylus, and method I could find and they all suck. Writing with a stylus on the iPad doesn&#8217;t feel like writing at all. It&#8217;s more like using an awkward crayon without the fun smell. So for meeting notes, it was back to a pen and notebook<a href="I">^notebook</a>.</p>

<p>When everyone started chatting about the <a href="http://kck.st/i9tWX1">Cosmonaut Kickstarter Project</a> from the <a href="http://www.theglif.com/">Glif</a> guys, I grunted my standard dismissive grunt and ignored them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2011/04/cosmonautj-stylus.png" alt="Cosmonautj stylus" /></p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking about it. I think they&#8217;re on to something with the whole fidelity mismatch thing. Doodling on the iPad using a finger and something like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/draft/id375570329?mt=8">Draft</a> or <a href="http://www.cocoabox.com/penultimate">Penultimate</a> works pretty well, and the Cosmonaut is designed to make <em>that</em> better rather than trying to improve regular note-taking.</p>

<p>I may have been wrong to dismiss this new stylus so quickly.</p>

<p>What the hell? The whole record is like that. And by that I mean <em>awesome</em>!</p>

<p>I pull <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lamb_Lies_Down_on_Broadway">The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</a> off the shelf a few times every year. I then stop everything I&#8217;m doing, and listen to it from start to finish. That&#8217;s kind of the whole point of a concept album, but this one is so very good it&#8217;s hard not to. Peter Gabriel left after this album, and Genesis became something else. &#8220;Lamb&#8221; is the best thing they&#8217;ve ever done.</p>

<p>Brett Terpstra shares a handy tool for downloading collections of his TextExpander<a href="TextExpander">^textexpander</a> snippets. The page lets you select a group of custom snippets, choose a shortcut prefix, and download a .textexpander file based on your options, ready to import into TextExpander.</p>

<p>Try it at <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/share/te-snippets/">http://brettterpstra.com/share/te-snippets/</a></p>

<p>I already maintain a large collection of custom snippets, but these sets include some great additions. TextExpander is one of those rare utilities that saves me more time than it takes to configure.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Truly, it is made of unicorns&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Jon Hicks seems to like his MacBook Air quite a lot. He should, the Air is the greatest computer ever made by man. I&#8217;m fortunate enough to also use a 27&#8221; iMac and late model 15&#8221; MacBook Pro. If forced to keep just one machine, I&#8217;d gladly choose the 11&#8221; Air. It&#8217;s tiny, fast, and beautiful to the eye and the touch.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air is one of those rare things that feels perfect in almost<a href="I'd">^1</a> every way.</p>
