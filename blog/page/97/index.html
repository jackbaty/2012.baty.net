  <div class="entry-content"><p>I keep choosing &#8220;old&#8221; technology: Film cameras, 900mhz phones, things like that. The latest is my mail client. I&#8217;d been using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla&#8217;s Thunderbird</a> since before it was really in any shape to be used daily. It&#8217;s a great piece of software, and free, but a couple annoying little bugs have recently caused me to give up and go back to using <a href="http://www.mutt.org">Mutt</a>.</p>

<p>Mutt is a terminal based mail client for unix. Yep, I have to read my mail in a terminal window and use my keyboard to navigate and VI to compose messages. I can crank through mailing lists more quickly and compose messages faster this way. Plus it&#8217;s almost completely configurable. Okay not almost, it is <em>completely</em> configurable. God I&#8217;m a geek.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/philosophygym.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Discusses things like…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is Time Travel Possible?</p></li>
<li><p>What is Knowledge?</p></li>
<li><p>The Consciousness Conundrum</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Seems like an easy intro to philosophy, which I know nothing about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been some disappointing behaviour lately around these parts. There have been things written and things hinted at which don&#8217;t line up exactly with reality. These things seem to be directed at my partners, Steve and Bryan Lewis. I wouldn&#8217;t normally bring it up, but these are not just my partners, they are also my friends.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to tell you a little bit about my friends.</p>

<p>I met Steve and Bryan about 10 years ago, just before they founded Fusionary Media. Shortly thereafter they asked me to join them as a third partner. This was not a trivial decision for me, but it was an easy one because I had always wanted to work with people who were driven by the same desire to do great work - to do things better than everyone else.</p>

<p>We started out small and worked hard. I&#8217;d never seen anyone work that hard. We didn&#8217;t talk about profits or salaries or wealth. What we talked about was creating an environment where smart, talented people would be allowed and encouraged to do great work. This hasn&#8217;t changed much in ten years.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve always had very high standards and expectations for the work that Fusionary produces. The painful part of working here is having to meet or exceed the high expectations - all the time. It&#8217;s a good pain, but not everyone can do it. It&#8217;s sometimes exasperating, but it&#8217;s ultimately worth it. You&#8217;ve seen our work.</p>

<p>Without this extra drive, without those two guys constantly editing, correcting, guiding and pushing to improve friggin&#8217; everything, Fusionary would be a good-but-not-great web shop. We would be wasting the talented team we&#8217;ve assembled (and it&#8217;s a <strong>very</strong> talented team) because even the best teams need coaching.</p>

<p>Our work is the result of Steve and Bryan helping a brilliant team of people produce to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>They do all of this while maintaining a level of honesty and integrity that always amazes me. It&#8217;s built in - hardwired. To suggest otherwise is to have completely missed the point. It means you&#8217;re just not paying attention.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Y&#8217;all keep a list of things to do, right? Groceries, fix that screen door, have the oil changed, and on and on. I have one too and it has some important stuff on it: some personal, some professional, some in between.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding that I need a second list. All the things on my current list fall under the same category: If they don&#8217;t get done I will not die unfulfilled. For example, right now it&#8217;s a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I could be working on finishing up a web site, I could be doing laundry or mowing my lawn. But I&#8217;m not. Instead I&#8217;m trying to find out what&#8217;s involved in taking piano lessons and also reading web site forums on the philosophy of photography.</p>

<p>The normal list is full of those things that keep life and career moving, without which all other lists are made irrelevant. Probably a good idea to keep that one, then.</p>

<p>The new, second list will contain those things that I absolutely must get done before I die. So then, in no particular order…</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learn to play the piano.</strong> How hard can it be to learn to plink out a couple tunes here and there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn to speak Spanish.</strong> I&#8217;ve tried this before with almost no sucess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scuba off the Great Barrier Reef.</strong> I&#8217;ve done it in the Muskegon river, but that&#8217;s not really the same thing is it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reread the entire Bible.</strong> This time I&#8217;m gonna cheat and skip all the &#8220;begat&#8221; sections near the beginning. Or maybe I&#8217;ll just skip to Revelations, which is the cool chapter anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surf in Mexico</strong> This might be cheating because I&#8217;ve already got this one booked, thanks to brillian planning by <a href="http://www.slewpop.com/">Steve</a> and <a href="http://www.bryan-lewis.com">Bryan</a> for celebrating my 40th birthday.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actually understand the difficult books I&#8217;ve read.</strong> Godel Escher Bach, Infinite Jest, The Elegant Universe, Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create better photographs</strong> - at least by my standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Survive parenting a teenage girl.</strong> It&#8217;s the most difficult, challenging, frustrating and absolutely wonderful thing I&#8217;ve ever done</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write more poetry.</strong> They&#8217;re like emotional bookmarks along the way.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Gotta run. Stuff to do, ya know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alice Cooper is blasting other rock stars who are planning to perform &#8220;benefits&#8221; in order to oust GW. Folks like Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp and R.E.M are committing &#8220;&#8230;treason against Rock and Roll because Rock and Roll is the antithesis of politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>I love this quote…</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to vote for, you&#8217;re a bigger moron than they are. Why are we rock stars? Because we&#8217;re morons. We sleep all day, we play music at night and very rarely do we sit around reading the Washington Journal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Alice is still cool, and suprisingly, relevant even today. On the other hand, the bands mentioned earlier, well, aren&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been watching an odd assortment of documentary or near-documentary films lately. For those interested, here&#8217;s a summary.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/touching_the_void/">Touching the Void</a></strong> *****</p>

<p>Story of two mountain climbers&#8217; nightmare while climbing the Siula Grande mountain in the Peruvian Andes. One of them breaks his leg and from then on it&#8217;s pinned-to-your-seat dramatization coupled with interviews with the climbers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/step_into_liquid/">Step into Liquid</a></strong> ****</p>

<p>Breathtaking photography of surfers and surfing around the world.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/capturing_the_friedmans/">Capturing the Friedmans</a></strong> *****</p>

<p>Arnold Friedman, normal guy with a normal family, is accused of being a child pornographer. The movie documents he and his family&#8217;s decline and disintegration in the following months and years.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/weather_underground/">The Weather Underground</a></strong> **</p>

<p>Story of the Weatherman, a radical group of anti-war protesters formed during the 60s.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_voyage_to_italy/">My Voyage to Italy</a></strong> ****</p>

<p>Martin Scorcese spends a few hours talking about his favorite films of Italian cinema. Listening to him causes a contagious affect that makes me want to watch everything he&#8217;s talking about.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/war_photographer/">War Photographer</a></strong> ****</p>

<p>Portrait of world-renowned photojournalist James Nachtwey.</p>
