  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh boy. If I even <em>mention</em> a new development platform around <a href="http://www.fusionary.com">the office</a>, people start to break out in hives. Let&#8217;s just say the phrase &#8220;Now what?!&#8221; has been bandied about on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>But this time it&#8217;s different… honest!</p>

<p>If ever a bandwagon felt like a good one to jump on, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is it. This looks to be, based on a weekend or so of fiddling, a fantastic framework. Just reading the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/">API</a> gave me any number of No Freakin&#8217; Way! moments. In all fairness, I have to admit that I have very little experience with some of the also fabulous (I&#8217;m sure) Java frameworks, but they&#8217;re… well… Java. And .NET? That&#8217;s not even Java, it&#8217;s… you know who.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait to see how this pans out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I was browsing, reading feeds, generally minding my own business when I came across the <a href="http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/">Roku SoundBridge</a>. I&#8217;ve known things like this existed, and for some time considered Apples Airport Express, but nothing really clicked. This clicked. I had an old Onkyo receiver that wasn&#8217;t being used, so I dropped that in my bedroom, plugged in the SoundBridge to the analog jacks and fired her up. There was my shared iTunes library via wireless and rendevouz - instantly accessible. The joy is that it comes with a little remote so I don&#8217;t have to be near the computer to manage what I&#8217;m listening to. It will also play internet radio directly, without needing iTunes running. Oh, and it looks cool, too. Pretty nifty, if you ask me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My recent experiment with <a href="http://www.davidco.com">Getting Things Done</a> has been a huge success. With it, I know that everything that needs doing will get done, and sometimes even on time. I still tend to do the fun stuff first, but at least I know what I&#8217;m neglecting, thanks to the ever-present Next Actions list. The concept of &#8220;capturing everything in a trusted system&#8221; is the key. So, for those of you who might be interested, here&#8217;s my Trusted System™…</p>

<h3>Capture</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.moleskine.co.uk/gallery.html">Moleskine mini notebook</a></strong>  - <a href="http://jackbaty.com/2005/01/10/my-version-of-the-hipster-pda/">Mine</a> goes with me everywhere. I love it. It feels good, looks good and works exactly how it should.</p>

<p><strong>Inbox</strong> - Just a physical inbox for collecting new paper that needs processing (several times daily)</p>

<p><strong>Email</strong> - My email inbox gets processed and filed regularly. I transfer the relevant information directly into one of the other capture apps, usually Tinderbox.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a></strong> - Expensive and kinda funny-looking, but I always have a Map View open for dropping in quick notes about things that need tending to. This also gets processed several times a day.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php">DEVONthink</a></strong> - This isn&#8217;t really a GTD app for me, but it does capture a shitload of stuff. Text snippets, quotes, parts of web pages, images, pdf manual, you name it, it goes in there. And it&#8217;s all easy to find and organize later.</p>

<p><strong>43 Folders</strong> - Yep, one unit with 31 daily slots and one with 12 monthly. Drop bills, notes, even heartworm pills in there and forget about them until the time comes.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p><strong>Tinderbox</strong> - I use Tinderbox for organizing everything that has been captured and processed. My Projects, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe lists go here. I wanted to fall in love with OmniOutliner 3 instead, but it feels sluggish and most of the improvements aren&#8217;t implemented as well as I&#8217;d hoped.</p>

<p>There you have it, in a nutshell. Works for me.</p>

<p>As a side note, the newcomer here is DEVONthink. I&#8217;ve not even finished the demo period yet and it&#8217;s become indispensable for keeping track of things I read online. Better than bookmarking in most cases because I just copy the relevant bits over. Really improves the signal/noise ratio. And for research it&#8217;s nearly perfect. You can see a <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html">nice example of DEVONthink usage</a> by Steven Johnson.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If someone were to ask me, &#8220;What is an artist?&#8221; I&#8217;d probably just stare blankly and shrug my shoulders. On the other hand, watching <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rivers_and_tides_andy_goldsworthy_working_with_time/">Rivers and Tides</a>, a film about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy made me want to jump up and down screaming &#8220;There&#8217;s one, right there!&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/goldsworthy.jpg" alt="Goldsworthy" /></p>

<p>While the movie was beautifully filmed and scored, the best part was being allowed to sit quietly and marvel at Mr. Goldsworthy&#8217;s work and his approach to creating each piece. I can&#8217;t imagine a dedication so strong toward things so ephemeral. I sat with a big stupid grin on my face, head slightly shaking in disbelief while watching him build great, delicate structures, soon only to have them destroyed by tides or sun or wind.</p>

<p>I watched it alone, and wished immediately that I hadn&#8217;t. It needed to be talked about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve used Firefox daily, since it was an early Phoenix release. On Windows it was pretty much either that or IE, and we all know that&#8217;s a no-brainer. Firefox followed me faithfully when I switched to using a Mac and I still think it&#8217;s a great browser. But…</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/omniwebscreen-7.jpg" alt="Omniwebscreen-7" /></p>

<p>Since OS X is so impressive and useful, It makes sense to take advantage of what&#8217;s available. Things like integrated spellchecking, text services and all of the loveliness that is Cocoa. It occurred to me that Firefox misses on most of these. It&#8217;s time to take a look at what else is available. Safari is pretty good, but I just can&#8217;t get used to the brushed metal-ness of it. What I&#8217;m interested in is <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>. It&#8217;s not free, but that&#8217;s never been the deciding factor for me anyway. After about 15 minutes of the demo, I know a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s slower than Firefox. Not significantly, but noticeably.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphic Tabs. The little  &#8220;tab&#8221; thumbnails are great. The ability to select a tab visually is one of those &#8220;Doh!&#8221; things.</p></li>
<li><p>Real OS X widgets. Yes children, you can navigate web forms, including select (popup) elements with the keyboard. No more filling out a form, stop! grab the mouse, select the state from a popup, and move on. Love this.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration with OS X services. Selecting text and pushing it into DevonTHINK with a single keystroke is the way to do research.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Javascript doesn&#8217;t seem to work very well. The nifty calendar thingy I&#8217;ve been using for web apps, for one. Hope this doesn&#8217;t become too common.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Another 15 minutes will probably reveal even more. The good/bad ratio remains to be seen.</p>
