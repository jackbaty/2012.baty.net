  <div class="entry-content"><p>Theres a <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/late_projects_are_late_one_day_at_a_time.php">rather interesting thread</a> going on now over at the 37Signals blog, all started with Jason Fried quoting Fred Brooks…</p>

<blockquote><p>How does a project get to be a year behind schedule? One day at a time.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you wade through the comments on the post, youll find some interesting things. Here are my favorites…</p>

<blockquote><p>Fixed prices are broken promises</p></blockquote>

<p>And…</p>

<blockquote><p>Program maintenance is an entropy-increasing process, and even its most skillful execution only delays the subsidence of the system into unfixable obsolescence.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8230;and from JF…</p>

<blockquote><p>Thats the root of the problem  saying you know everything about what you need and how its going to be implemented even before the first pixel is painted or line of code is written.To those that think theres only one way to do anything: youre off by a factor of 100. There are lots of ways to do things, but you have to believe in them and yourself enough to try them. You have to educate people, you have to ask people to trust you, you have to trust them, and you have to deliver. And I promise you that once you start delivering theyll forget all about the old way of doing things.</p>

<p>Weve done it and you can do it too. Dont let anyone tell you you cant. Dont let anyone tell you theres only one way. Dont let anyone tell you rigid timelines and specs are the only way to work with clients. Its simply not true. It may be what people are used to, but there are much better ways if you just give them a try.&#8211;Jason Fried</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2006-07-30T17:31:14-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 30<span>th</span>, 2006</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After much hand-wringing and the selling of my 20D, Ive finally bought myself a Ricoh GR Digital</p>

<p><img src="/images/gr_digital_j_a.jpg" alt="gr_digital_j_a.jpg" /></p>

<p>This unique compact camera has gotten very mixed reviews. The fly in the ointment has generally been comprised of 2 things: noise at high ISO and very slow RAW write speeds. Both of these complaints are completely valid but they dont tell the whole story.</p>

<p>What most reviewers tend to focus on are 100% crops of photos taken at all ISOs of things like cereal box labels, watch faces and other things none of us really want to photograph. Of course I care if the thing vignettes horribly or that any contrasty edge is fringed with purple. But I dont care <em>that</em> much, especially if none of the problems are noticeable at normal resolutions and print sizes.</p>

<p>The thing lacking in many reviews is any sort of attention to how a camera handles - how it <em>feels</em> during normal use. This, more than anything for me is what determines whether I like a camera or not. For example, Ive got a Fuji F10 which is generally raved about by reviewers. I hate it. Its fidgety, ugly and feels hard and cheap. The menus are confusing and the button layout is mediocre. In low light, its fantastic, but thats not enough to make me want to carry it with me.</p>

<p>Then lets talk about the GR Digital.</p>

<p>I read the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0509/05091301ricoh_gr.asp">press release</a> on dpreview.com and was immediately interested. Here was a high-quality pocketable camera with a fast, wide fixed lens. Immediately, the pixel peeping reviewers started whining. Its so noisy as to be unusable above ISO 200. It takes <em>forever</em> to write RAW files. and so on. I gave up on it and moved on. Later, I started reading reviews by folks who actually owned and used the thing. Funny, they all seemed to love it. Handles like a dream. A beautiful, film-like quality to the grain - especially in black and white mode. All the manual controls you could ever need. Very good controls and menu layout. Extremely responsive. I started wanting one again, so I sold my 20D and bought one. Ive only had it for a few days, so its too early to tell, but so far I totally love it.</p>

<p>Whats good</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build quality. This thing looks and feels very solid. Its blacker than in most photos and the crisp raised white letters on the lens add a nice touch. The magnesium alloy body and rubberized grip make this camera feel better to the touch than any compact camera Ive ever had my hands on.</p></li>
<li><p>Control layout. The adjustment dials (front and back) are familiar to anyone whose used a modern DSLR. The behavior when pressing the rear dial is completely customizable so that 4 of the settings I use most are one click away.</p></li>
<li><p>Menus are easy to read and use.</p></li>
<li><p>Fully manual mode with a match-needle type readout.</p></li>
<li><p>Macro mode is outstanding. Getting really close - to about 1.5 centimeters - is a lot of fun.</p></li>
<li><p>High ISO in black and white mode does actually produce noise that looks very similar to Tri-X pushed a stop or two. If you like that sort of thing as much as I do, this is a huge plus. Limited noise reduction keeps things very sharp, even with noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Available external optical viewfinder</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Whats not so good</p>

<ul>
<li><p>RAW write speed is very slow. I dont shoot raw with this camera so this isnt a huge deal for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Lotsa noise at higher ISO. If you want creamy, smeary smooth images at higher ISOs, get the Fuji F30.</p></li>
<li><p>Pop-up flash. I dont like it, particularly when the index finger of my left hand prevents it from popping up.</p></li>
<li><p>Its way too expensive (I paid $650) for an ordinary compact point-and-shoot that doesnt even have a freakin zoom lens. Good thing its not an ordinary point-and-shoot. And I dont want a zoom lens.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve fallen a bit off the GTD wagon of late. How do I know? First, I missed 2 things I should&#8217;ve easily gotten done recently. Another clue is that I feel like I have too many things to think about and I just <em>know</em> I&#8217;m forgetting something. And I&#8217;ve not done a thorough weekly review in 3 weeks. This is bad. Merlin Mann talks a bit about <a href="[http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/24/b2gtd-mind-sweep/](http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/24/b2gtd-mind-sweep/">getting back on the GTD wagon</a>) by doing a Mind Sweep. This is good advice for anyone who, like me, has not bet Getting Things Done. The takaway for me is to always remember to completely separate planning from doing&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the few things I find frustrating about the keyboard on my MacBook Pro is the location of the Control key. I <em>really</em> want to swap the Control and Function keys, but can&#8217;t find a way to do it. I did find that I can reassign all of the modifier keys using System Preferences->Keyboard and Mouse->Modifier Keys. This isn&#8217;t too bad, since changing the Caps Lock key to Control works almost as well. Especially handy for all you Vim and Emacs folks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Using Terminal in OS X is pretty nice overall. One thing that can be annoying is that when viewing directory listings, directories are rendered in blue, which is difficult to see if you&#8217;re like me and use a dark background color. I found the following somewhere and it makes things a bit better by changing directories to cyan. Just add this to your ~/.profile &#8230;</p>

<p>export LSCOLORS=gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad  # cyan directories</p>

<p>There, that&#8217;s better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve got an idea. Let&#8217;s get a bunch of 2-year olds, make them cry, and take a picture of them. Then we&#8217;ll caption the photos with some political hooha and call it art. Anything for a buck right? And it&#8217;s art, so that makes it all okay.</p>

<p>Oh damn, seems that <a href="[http://www.paulkopeikingallery.com/artists/greenberg/exhibitions/endtimes/index.htm](http://www.paulkopeikingallery.com/artists/greenberg/exhibitions/endtimes/index.htm">Jill Greenberg</a>) has beaten us to it…</p>

<p><img src="/images/therapture_b.jpg" alt="therapture_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>The photos are over-processed crap. This sort of thing probably shouldn&#8217;t be illegal, but it&#8217;s sure as hell unnecessary. The parents of those kids should be ashamed of themselves. Sure, kids cry all the time, but <em>forcing</em> them to just to make a buck and a weak political statement isn&#8217;t art, it&#8217;s abuse.</p>

<p>If the zoom started at 28mm instead of 38mm it would be pretty tempting. At least it doesn&#8217;t look like a silver Altoids tin.</p>
