  <div class="entry-content"><p>There appears to be a bit of backlash against bringing laptops into meetings. An example from Rands&#8217; piece, &#8220;The Laptop Herring&#8221;:http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/08/31/the_laptop_herring.html…</p>

<p>bq. Everyone wanted to know if there was a situation where it was OK to whip out the laptop. My answer, over and over again, is &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>The argument, as far as I can tell, is that anyone with a laptop open will spend the entire meeting Facebooking or otherwise not paying attention. This is simply not true. At least not entirely. As a shining example to the contrary let&#8217;s take, well, me. I need to take notes in meetings or I might as well not show up. As much as I love my &#8220;Moleskine&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine, there&#8217;s just no way to keep up by writing things longhand. So, I fire up a &#8220;Tinderbox&#8221;:http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox document and, surprise! actually take notes. As a precaution against distraction, I turn off wireless and close all unrelated apps. Easy!</p>

<p>And what about those who <em>are</em> wasting time on their laptops? If there are people in a meeting with enough free time to drift off-topic on a laptop or doodle on a notepad or just daydream, perhaps they <em>should not have been invited to the meeting in the first place.</em> This whole thing is a process problem and has nothing to do with technology. It&#8217;s not the attendees and their laptops who are to blame, either. It&#8217;s the meeting&#8217;s organizer(s).</p>

<p><em>Don&#8217;t invite people who have better things to do</em></p>

<p>Nine out of ten meetings are not worth the cost. And they cost a lot. There&#8217;s a tendency to automatically invite anyone even remotely related to the topic. Many of those folks have very little reason to attend and what&#8217;s worse, most of them might actually have <em>real</em> work to do.</p>

<p>So then, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ve cut down our list to only critical attendees. Should laptops be allowed always? Nope. Top-of-the-head examples where a no laptop policy works&#8230;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Creative meetings. Might be one person that could capture notes toward the end, but most of the time it&#8217;s just idea bouncing. Besides, creative meetings shouldn&#8217;t have more than 4 or 5 people in them anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, I can&#8217;t think of any others.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Where might laptops be essential?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&#8220;SCRUM&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29 sessions where developers need to reference, run or demonstrate code.</p></li>
<li><p>Any meeting with a combination of essential attendees and a requirement to capture notes.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&#8217;s pretend that I&#8217;m in a meeting and don&#8217;t need to be. This is unfortunately unavoidable in many environments. The Rands article reads my mind…</p>

<p>bq. You&#8217;re on the defensive now and you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;But Rands, while I&#8217;m not actively contributing to this meeting, I am getting work done on my laptop.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m thinking! But…</p>

<p>bq. No, you&#8217;re not. You&#8217;re giving the same partial attention to your laptop task that you&#8217;re giving to the meeting. You are doing two things poorly rather than one thing well.</p>

<p>Oh I most certainly am getting work done. While I agree that effectively multitasking things that require a good deal of concentration is impossible, there are many tasks that don&#8217;t need my full attention. The &#8220;scrubbing the bug database&#8221; example is one of them. I do a lot of traffic control this way, and I can do it well without much thought. Processing my email inbox is another. Scan, tag, label, archive. No problem, and I <em>still</em> know what&#8217;s been talked about in the meeting.</p>

<p>Summary? If meetings are planned properly, laptops are all good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to smoke. For about 10 years I averaged 2 packs of non-filtered Lucky Strikes every day. I was damn good at it; Chicks dug me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbaty/18804062/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/12/18804062_155dbd0996.jpg" alt="Spring break, '84" /></a></p>

<p>That photo was taken in 1984 and is one of the rare shots of me as a smoker. I quit about 10 years ago. Times sure have changed. Tonight I went out for dinner at a local restaurant and spent most of my time complaining about the guys smoking at the table next to us. It was messing with my food and making my eyes sting!</p>

<p>Not smoking is better than smoking. I know that. But sometime over the past 10 years the chicks stopped digging me as much and I&#8217;ve become kinduva wuss. I sometimes wonder if smoking (or not) had anything to do with it.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2007-08-27T22:10:40-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 27<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ll just go ahead and say it, <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> is the most useful app on my Mac. Period. I&#8217;d love to write an in depth review sometime, but for now, the highlights&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>Things I love most about Tinderbox</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deep as you need.</strong> Spend the time, and when it comes to information management, there&#8217;s not much Tinderbox can&#8217;t do.</li>
<li><strong>Incredibly fast to use</strong>. I mean, just hammer away with the keyboard, learn about 4 shortcuts and you&#8217;ll be in a note-taking frenzy in no time.</li>
<li><strong>All those views!</strong> Maps, Outlines, Chart, frickin&#8217; Treemaps. All at the same time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Speaking of the Map view, check this out&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="/images/tinderbox-map-view.html"><img src="/images/tinderbox-map-view-thumb-500x335.png" alt="tinderbox-map-view.png" /></a></p>

<p>Tinderbox 4 introduced a few changes that make the map view almost infinitely useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shapes:</strong> Notes can be displayed using a variety of shapes. This is great for large, complex maps where color is not enough of a visual hint.</li>
<li><strong>Badges:</strong> Little icons add a lot of information</li>
<li><strong>Note content:</strong> You can now see a portion of each note&#8217;s contents right on the map. That is a <em>huge</em> improvement. In fact, it&#8217;s what pulled me back to Tinderbox completely when otherwise I might use a mindmapping app instead.</li>
</ul>


<p>The outline view is equally useful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tinderbox-outline-view.png" alt="tinderbox-outline-view.png" /></p>

<p>See the little icons down the left? They show relatively how much text each note contains. Oh, and the icons gradually change color with age. Genius!</p>

<p><strong>Things I don&#8217;t care for or wish were different.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows version</strong>. I think Tinderbox should be a killer <em>Mac</em> app. The resources and (I assume) compromises that must be made to move cross-platform can&#8217;t be helping the Mac version very much.</li>
<li><strong>Odd UI</strong>. The UI still looks a little goofy in parts. This in no way detracts from the app&#8217;s usefulness, but those who spend a lot of time in apps by, say the Omni Group, will notice that Tinderbox looks a little clunkier.</li>
<li><strong>Not enough Mac goodness</strong>. Things I&#8217;m used to in Cocoa apps are not entirely present in Tinderbox. (Writeroom, Edit in Textmate, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Things I don&#8217;t use, and possibly should…</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agents</strong>. I know, I know, agents rock and make Tinderbox into a veritable platform all by itself. I use them, but only in a limited fashion. I&#8217;ve found that too much tinkering with agents causes me to end up in a morass of confusing dependencies and self-inflicted bugs. I generate enough bugs already, so I stay away from complicating my note-taking app with them.</li>
<li><strong>Exporting</strong>. Tinderbox can export itself into just about any shape, size or format you can imagine. I never use it. The things I write in Tinderbox end up simply copied and pasted into a wiki or blog post or just left quietly as an archive of notes kept all to myself.</li>
</ul>


<p>I should mention that <a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/">Mark Bernstein</a>, the developer, is exceptionally responsive and helpful. He&#8217;s also rather opinionated about Tinderbox, which is one of the reason it&#8217;s such great software.</p>

<p>In summary, Tinderbox is friggin&#8217; sweet. It&#8217;s not cheap compared to some apps, but then again, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;some app.&#8221; It&#8217;s unique, useful software that&#8217;s well worth the investment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Iain Levison has an interesting take on Drunk Driving and its enforcement</p>

<p>bq. Most of us think we can have a few beers and drive safely.  You know why we think that?  Because we can!  Only two types of people can&#8217;t&#8230;teenagers and alcoholics. Teenagers are still learning how to drink and drive, and alcoholics can&#8217;t control their drinking.  Virtually all drunk driving accidents&#8230;by some accounts as few as 5,000 a year… are caused by these two groups.  And the remaining ninety percent of us have paid a steep price indeed.</p>
