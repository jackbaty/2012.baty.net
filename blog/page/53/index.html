<p>Please see <a href="[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/squid_and_the_whale/](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/squid_and_the_whale/)">The Squid and the Whale</a>. Jeff Daniel&#8217;s performance  is truly great. This movie is about what happens to kids (and their parents) during divorce. It will make you laugh, but only because it&#8217;s better than the alternative. And you&#8217;ll get to hear <em>Metamorphosis</em> described as &#8220;Kafka-esque&#8221;. It&#8217;s painful, adult, true, and a terrible sort of funny.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an interesting chart in there with deaths per million cars for a number of vehicles. It&#8217;s interesting to see how poorly the S.U.V.s fared.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been writing scripts the past couple of days for synching things up between a few servers. I&#8217;ve wasted too much time already with 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When using rsync anywhere near mounted Windows shares, always include the option <code>-modify-window=1</code>. This will prevent rsync from trying to copy nearly <em>every</em> file each time. It has something to do with the differences in how Windows stores modification times.</p></li>
<li><p>The latest OS X update to Tiger broke the &#8211;delete option. Target deletion simply doesn&#8217;t work any more. As a workaround, I&#8217;ve installed the <a href="[http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/](http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/)">DarwinPorts</a> version instead. Then I moved the broken binary out of the way and symlinked the ports version in its place. Something like this (assuming you already have DarwinPorts)…</p></li>
</ol>


<p>`</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install rsync

sudo mv /usr/local/bin/rsync /usr/local/bin/rsync-tiger

sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/rsync /usr/local/bin/rsync
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was so happy to read Mark Morford&#8217;s piece titled <em><a href="[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/03/15/notes031506.DTL](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/03/15/notes031506.DTL)">I am Done with Violence</a></em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Violence no longer informs me. It no longer has the power to teach. It is a one-note song I&#8217;ve heard so many times it has lost its power to stun or impress or delve deep. It now merely tears at the fabric of the soul, punches holes in the anima, scrapes its knuckles on the pavement of hate, and you can shrug and roll your eyes and go watch &#8220;The Hills Have Eyes&#8221; or &#8220;Saw II&#8221; or even play some hi-res shockingly ultraviolent video game and enjoy the brutal escapism and wallow in the bloodshed while pretending it&#8217;s not slowly, quietly blackening your world view like a smoker sucking down another carton of Marlboro Reds, but deep down, where the meanings are, I think maybe, just maybe, you might be seriously mistaken.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I hope his attitude marks a quiet movement of some sort. Please?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tracking time on projects is hard. No, that&#8217;s not true, it&#8217;s easy to do, it&#8217;s hard to do consistently and accurately. Holding to my never-wavering belief that software can solve all of life&#8217;s problems, I&#8217;ve tried 6 or 8 time tracking apps. Each of them failed in its own way.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve gone back to the most reliable and easy to use time tracking tool available - paper. I track my time by 15 minute intervals, so the form I use looks like this…</p>

<p><img src="/images/timesheet-screen.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I just write the project&#8217;s name on the left and fill in each 15 minute block as I think of it. End of day, just add it up. It works pretty well for me. If you want to try it yourself, <a href="/images/timesheet.pdf">download timesheet.pdf</a> and give it a whirl.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="[http://37signals.com/](http://37signals.com/)">37signals</a> gets a lot of flack in blog comments and elsewhere from people who probably aren&#8217;t as good, and likely have serious self-esteem issues. I disagree with the haters in all cases. The 37signals folks almost always say exactly what I meant, only better and to a much larger audience. A fun thing they&#8217;ve begun doing on their <a href="[http://37signals.com/svn/](http://37signals.com/svn/)">Signals vs. Noise</a> weblog  is to post some of the highlights of recent <a href="[http://www.campfirenow.com/](http://www.campfirenow.com/)">Campfire</a> conversations. It&#8217;s another good idea I&#8217;ll probably copy here.</p>

<p>And speaking of copying…</p>

<p>One of the Campfire items <a href="[http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/fly_on_the_wall_week_of_march_10.php](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/fly_on_the_wall_week_of_march_10.php)">mentioned</a> was a reaction by Jamis Buck to someone suggesting that developing Basecamp was easy…</p>

<blockquote><p>A forum poster wrote, &#8220;We might just use one of our coders and designer to make a clone of this project manager to be used on our own servers. It would just save us the hassle.&#8221; Jamis: &#8220;hahahayah, just whip out basecamp in an afternoonhow hard could it be?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When Basecamp first lauched I was immediately in love. It was just so damn simple! <a href="[http://www.fusionary.com/](http://www.fusionary.com/)">We</a> were using an Issue Management System I wrote in ColdFusion back in 1997 and it was showing its age. Before signing up, I wanted to take it for a few laps. Overall, Basecamp was perfect. There were, however,  some critical (for us) features missing or implemented in a way I didn&#8217;t care for (File uploads, inline image display and notifications, to name a few). So, I set about to culling the best ideas from Basecamp and writing my own version of it for internal use. This was on a Friday evening. Monday morning <strong>I had built 80% of the existing Basecamp feature set</strong>, and added inline attachments, configurable permissions, better To-dos and a nifty email notification system - in three days and in PHP no less! (Let&#8217;s pretend for a moment that I didn&#8217;t spend the next week or two tweaking and debugging. I did say 80% right?)</p>

<p>Was I able to do this because programming is easy? Nope, it&#8217;s hard - at least doing it well is hard. Was it because I&#8217;m a programming genius? Nope, I&#8217;ve seen <a href="[http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/](http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/)">Jamis&#8217;</a> code and he&#8217;s a far far better programmer than I&#8217;ll ever be. The reason I could do it is that 37signals had done the truly hard part - <em>designing the damn thing</em>. I don&#8217;t mean visual design, but interaction design. The way they planned  features and implemented the majority of them was (and is) brilliant. What they knew to leave out was even more so.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot from those guys, but I think maybe I&#8217;ll just subscribe to their products from now on and be done with it.</p>
