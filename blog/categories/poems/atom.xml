    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"That's my boyfriend!" she tells us
as the grey-haired man pushes himself
slowly backward. Using his feet.
The wheelchair moved more easily that way.</p>

<p>"I think the world of her," he says
being careful not to move too quickly
lest he jar his neck brace. (She calls it a "halo.")
His age amplifying his injuries</p>

<p>Her face, at age 91, beams as he says this.
And she suddenly looks exactly
as I imagine she did at age 18
Kind words will do that
Those kind in particular
Especially in this place</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>why can't I go insane<br/>
the way other poets do?<br/>
why not blame them for this mess?<br/>
why not find the same excuses<br/>
and follow faeries into the darkened woods<br/>
where we all move about freely<br/>
and rhyme?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"What the hell is this, then?"
"f I didn't know better<br/>
I'd say it was poetry."</p>

<p>Well, that's exactly what it is, I say.<br/>
Especially since you don't know better<br/>
anyway.<br/>
It may not look like poetry<br/>
unless, of course<br/>
I wrap each<br/>
line<br/>
like this.</p>

<p>Then who's to say?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are things I must do
all of them terribly important
today they are terribly important
Certainly there's a mown lawn
a clean car, a balanced checkbook
a collection of tasks
gleefully crossed off
one list or another
all leading to a future safely
lined with the comfort of having finished
so many very important things</p>

<p>But in the meantime
Where is the art?
When will the poems be written?
Where is the love?
Who will teach me to play music - and when?
And what will the children remember?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are glasses on the nightstand<br/>
The pair she reads with<br/>
Being now the only thing next to me</p>

<p>They gather and focus the sunlight<br/>
coming in through the window<br/>
onto the pile of unread books</p>
