  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2012/fuji-and-m4.jpg" alt="Fuji X-Pro1 and Leica M4" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m never going to &#8220;go completely digital&#8221; or &#8220;use only film&#8221; since I cannot completely give up either. Not that I haven&#8217;t tried. One day I convince myself the only thing that matters is film, and I buy the greatest film camera I can think of because that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll ever need or use ever ever again. A week (or month) goes by and I decide I&#8217;m frustrated with scanning or whatever and I think I&#8217;d prefer something quick and easy, so I find some new hot digital camera that will solve all my problems.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s never going to end, I know that. But knowing doesn&#8217;t help.</p>

<p>For example, I recently had a disappointing week shooting film in low light. Tri-X shot at 1250 ISO and processed in Diafine does pretty well, but even that pushes shutter speeds down to 1/30th or so and inevitably motion blur ruins everything. Tired of fighting it, I looked to digital.</p>

<p>I &#8220;solved&#8221; the problem by buying a Fuji X-Pro1 and a couple of lenses. How does that solve the problem? Well, I love the hybrid viewfinder, analog controls, and of course the excellent high ISO performance. ISO 6400 is usable, and The Fujinon 35mm 1.4 is plenty fast. Boom! It&#8217;s like best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Except then I picked up my trusty Leica M4. There&#8217;s nothing like the feel of that camera. It&#8217;s visceral. Besides, what else does one need? No batteries or whizbang features to get in the way. Pure photography! And I have an awesome and under-utilized wet darkroom just begging for more film, so I start shopping again.</p>

<p>You see how it is? It&#8217;s a grand form of rationalization. Eventually, I&#8217;ll need to accept the fact that I really love the very old film process as well as and the very newest digital wizardry. It&#8217;ll have to be both. There, that&#8217;s settled. Right?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s unfortunate, because Calepin really is (was) a nice, easy, Markdown

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As much as I like the end result of this blog using Octopress, getting there
isn&#8217;t as easy as I&#8217;d like.</p>

<p><a href="http://calepin.co">Calepin</a> on the other hand, lacks almost every feature of
modern blogging platforms. This is not a bad thing. Also, Calepin fits how I
think, and makes publishing so easy it&#8217;s silly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a Calepin blog, <a href="http://copingmechanism.com/">CopingMechanism.com</a> for
a few months now and really like it. The latest post goes into a bit more
detail into my <a href="http://copingmechanism.com/octopress-or-calepin.html">Octopress vs. Calepin dilemma</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To the handful of you subscribed to the RSS feed here, I apologize for messing things up again. First, I changed blogging platforms, which modified some of the post titles. Then a couple of days ago, I thought I&#8217;d try running the entire blog out of an Amazon S3 bucket. This worked great, but required that I use a subdomain rather than the apex. The feed was pointing at jackbaty.com,  which is now redirected to www.jackbaty.com, causing duplicate entries.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try not to do that again, but as soon as a static blogging platform comes along that works as well as Octopress, but with fewer dependencies, I will probably want to try it, so no promises.</p>

<p>Otherwise, using an S3 bucket for hosting a static site is pretty slick. No need to run or share a server, no Apache config, etc. Since I use <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> everything is generated locally, so to &#8220;publish&#8221; changes I use <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> to sync things. There are a couple of pull requests waiting to be pulled into Octopress which will take care of that for me with the built-in &#8220;rake deploy&#8221; task, but for now I do it manually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I become angry while driving. Not mildly annoyed, but full-on vein-popping, teeth-grittingly furious. This isn&#8217;t the exception either. It happens nearly every time I get behind the wheel.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not normally aggressive or prone to violence. In fact, I&#8217;d consider myself a pretty mild-mannered fella. Very roll-with-the-punches, I&#8217;d say. And yet, I am consumed with road rage during even the most basic commute. It&#8217;s not healthy.</p>

<p>I could relax while driving if people would simply remember a few of the rules we all learned in kindergarten.</p>

<ol>
<li>No cutting in line for any reason</li>
<li>You are not the only person who matters</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be such a DICK!</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s it. Follow those rules and I&#8217;m Mr. Happy. Ignore them and I go all self-appointed-vigilante, tensing up and spewing obscenities. I&#8217;m not looking for a fight. Honest. I simply feel the need to let folks know in no uncertain terms that they&#8217;ve just made a dick move and should stop doing that. Yelling and getting angry doesn&#8217;t help, which is something <em>I</em> should have learned in kindergarten. Despite my efforts, people still drive like assholes. The only likely outcome is that I&#8217;m going to die of a heart attack or gunshot wound.</p>

<p>If I can&#8217;t fix anyone else, I suppose I&#8217;m going to have to fix myself.</p>

<p>For the past week I&#8217;ve been practicing. I smile kindly at the guy sneaking out-of-turn through the 4-way stop. I just quietly shake my head when someone decides that turn signals are too much hassle to bother with. Deep Breaths help.</p>

<p>So far it&#8217;s only been mildly successful, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I arrive at my destination with unclenched teeth.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/evernote_logo.gif" title="Evernote" ></p>

<p>I love trying new software. My idea of a fine Sunday afternoon is installing updates and checking out every line in every release note. What this usually means is that I find reasons to try all sorts of applications, even if something I already use would work fine. I rationalize this behavior easily, but the fact is I just like messing around with my &#8220;system&#8221;. Today, while cleaning out my <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> notebooks, I spotted <a href="http://www.thesecretweapon.org/">The Secret Weapon</a>, &#8220;a no bs approach to personal productivity&#8221;. I read the blog and watched the videos and decided it was a bit too much for me. Besides, I&#8217;m a die-hard OmniFocus nerd. Aren&#8217;t I?</p>

<p>It got me thinking. What if I were to put <em>everything</em> in Evernote? That&#8217;s just crazy talk! After all, I&#8217;m the one who always complains that Evernote makes things too difficult to get back out again. It occurred to me that part of my problem is that it&#8217;s <em>too easy</em> to switch between apps and that the slight friction that Evernote introduces might actually be an advantage.</p>

<p>And so, operation &#8220;Everything Goes Into Evernote&#8221; began today. I&#8217;m using a modified version of The Secret Weapon&#8217;s approach to GTD and put OmniFocus aside for now. I&#8217;ve moved my scanned archives from the powerful DEVONthink Pro into a new Evernote notebook. Project notes have been migrated from VoodooPad. I&#8217;ve even imported my Simplenote notes. I spent a few hours on all of this today, sitting at the iMac on my home office&#8217;s desk. I&#8217;m now sitting in a chair using the MacBook Air and Evernote has synced everything up nicely. Plus, it&#8217;s all on my iPhone. This required no additional sync servers or setup on my part. Encouraging.</p>

<p>And since I tend to go all-in on stuff like this, I installed both Evernote Food and Evernote Hello. <a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt</a> is bringing in all of my tweets, blog posts, and other favorited/liked content around the web.</p>

<p>This all may become overwhelming to have in one place. I&#8217;m a fan of variety, so there&#8217;s a concern that I&#8217;ll just get bored again quickly. For now, though, everything goes into Evernote.</p>
