<div class="entry-content"><p>Shooting film is something that I&#8217;ve been doing for quite a while now. I own a half-dozen or more wonderful film cameras. I have scanners for digital display and a darkroom for making prints. It&#8217;s all very cool and interesting. There is something about shooting film that is magical and cannot be replaced by digital means. It&#8217;s also a pain in the ass and I&#8217;m running out of patience. Scanning 36 exposures of 35mm film is a horrible process that eats up an hour or two every time. That would be ok if the results I was getting were worth it. They&#8217;re not. On the other hand, I love the results I get from the medium format cameras. So let&#8217;s just say 35mm film is out, but 6x6 is in.</p>

<p>Now what? The answer, I&#8217;m almost ashamed to say, should maybe be digital. I&#8217;ve been thinking about what&#8217;s next for weeks. My first reflex told me that I wanted to replace my Leica M cameras with an M9. I owned the earlier M8 briefly but didn&#8217;t like the compromises it required (cropped sensor and IR issues.) The M9 is much more attractive, but at $7000 it would be a life-changing investment for me. Leica rangefinders have a fairly limited range, photographically speaking, and spending that kind of money on an M9 would mean I&#8217;d need to be limited by that range as well.</p>

<p>The question to ask is what kind of shooting do I do? Truth is, not much. That realization hurts a little, but there it is. I tinker, mostly. To a normal person, that would mean that any little point and shoot would be enough, but I&#8217;m not normal. What I want to shoot are portraits, some &#8220;street&#8221; and possibly some fine art things I haven&#8217;t even thought of yet. I also don&#8217;t want to give up medium format film - it&#8217;s just too great. And I don&#8217;t want to always wish I&#8217;d gotten a better camera.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now thinking I&#8217;ll own 3 cameras.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2011/06/Hasselblad-500-Classic-1990-1992.jpg" alt="Hasselblad 500 Classic 1990 1992" /></p>

<p><strong>Hasselblad 500C/M</strong>. I already own this camera, and a couple of terrific Zeiss lenses, film backs, prisms, and cases to go with it. The Hasselblad is a very frustrating camera to use at times, but I just love the results. Besides, it&#8217;s like a work of art and an engineering miracle all rolled into one even when it&#8217;s sitting on a shelf. I&#8217;m keeping it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2011/06/nikond700.jpg" alt="Nikond700" /></p>

<p><strong>Nikon D700</strong> There&#8217;s a reason everyone walks around with a big-ass DSLR all the time. They&#8217;re versatile, fast, and they do a great job. I keep selling my DSLRs because they&#8217;re uninteresting and I hate walking around looking like every other schmuck. But, the D700 is a terrific camera. I&#8217;ve owned the D300 and loved the autofocus and flash system. The D700 is full-frame, built very well, and does wonders in low light. It&#8217;s an obvious choice for just about any type of photography, and I should have one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2011/06/fuji-x100-04.jpg" alt="Fuji x100 04" /></p>

<p><strong>Fuji X100</strong> For everything else, for just walking around, and for the serious cool of it, I want the X100. An APS-C sensor and a real optical viewfinder. Plus a retro cool look and feel that fits my tastes exactly. This will be the camera I carry with me everywhere, replacing the M4 I use now. Not the same, but not so different either.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m covered. Medium format film, do-everything DSLR, and compact cameras. Sounds good to me.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE - November 24, 2011</strong></p>

<p>I was close. The D700 is indeed an awesome camera. Auto ISO up to 3200 results in the cleanest available light photos I&#8217;ve ever seen. Really terrific.</p>

<p>The X100 never really captured me enough to try. Fixed lens point-and-shoot cameras make sense, but something with the image quality of the X100 begs for interchangeable lenses, so I purchased an Olympus E-P3 with viewfinder instead. Nice camera, and I can put all sorts of interesting lenses on it.</p>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t expect back in June was that I would enjoy the D700 but wish it took film. As much as I find film to be a pain in the ass, I still prefer it. So I went all out and <a href="http://jackbaty.com/2011/11/nikon-f6/">bought an F6</a>. It&#8217;s everything everyone said it would be. I love it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE - December 24, 2011</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I did end up <a href="http://jackbaty.com/2011/12/fuji-x100/">buying an X100</a> and so far I&#8217;m glad I did. Now I need to decide whether or not to sell the E-P3. And so it goes.</p>
