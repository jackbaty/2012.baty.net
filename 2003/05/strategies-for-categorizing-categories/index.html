<div class="entry-content"><p>This month&#8217;s UETips (from <a href="http://www.uie.com">uie.com</a>) includes some reasearch notes about categorization on several large e-commerce sites. I&#8217;ve included the text of the message…</p>

<p>How does a site containing thousands of pages of content get users to</p>

<p>the content they seek quickly? There are many different strategies for</p>

<p>organizing content on sites and we recently took a hard look at five</p>

<p>of them.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been examining several e-commerce sites to see how they</p>

<p>handled the problem of categorizing large numbers of products. We were</p>

<p>interested in seeing if the different designers came up with different</p>

<p>methods and which methods were most effective.</p>

<p>Our recent apparel and home goods study turned out to be a good place</p>

<p>to start. Here we looked at thirteen different sites, each with a</p>

<p>similar product set.</p>

<p>Every site had some similar characteristics. First, they divided the</p>

<p>content into just a few top-level categories, such as &#8220;Women&#8221;, &#8220;Men&#8221;,</p>

<p>and &#8220;For the Home&#8221;. (Apparel is one of the few content types that</p>

<p>lends itself to such easy organization. Sites containing content such</p>

<p>as office supplies or support problems probably have to adopt</p>

<p>different top-level solutions, such as what Staples</p>

<p>[http://www.staples.com] has done.)</p>

<p>Also, they had similar pages that displayed pictures of all the items</p>

<p>within a given category. We call these pages product galleries. While</p>

<p>the number of items and the specific information that was presented</p>

<p>with each product image varied, all of the sites had basically the</p>

<p>same galleries.</p>

<p>What was different were the pages between the home page and the</p>

<p>galleries. We call these &#8220;department pages&#8221;, because they represent</p>

<p>what&#8217;s sold in a specific store&#8217;s departments. For these sites,</p>

<p>&#8220;departments&#8221; were categories such as women&#8217;s swimwear or table linen.</p>

<p>Among the thirteen sites we studied, we found five different</p>

<p>department-page designs. Most listed the departments in a left</p>

<p>navigation panel, with the galleries for that department listed in the</p>

<p>center. (Look at Macy&#8217;s department pages&#8211;http://www.macys.com&#8211;by</p>

<p>clicking on Women, then Tops.)</p>

<p>However, some got clever. For example, the Gap and Victoria&#8217;s</p>

<p>Secret (<a href="http://www.gap.com">http://www.gap.com</a>, <a href="http://www.victoriassecret.com">http://www.victoriassecret.com</a>) both used</p>

<p>a menu based department that wasn&#8217;t a separate page, but instead used</p>

<p>menus at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>Old Navy (<a href="http://www.oldnavy.com">http://www.oldnavy.com</a>) used a combination department and</p>

<p>gallery page where sometimes the left nav contains galleries and</p>

<p>sometimes it contains products. (Try clicking on Girls, then</p>

<p>Accessories. Compare that to clicking on Girls, then Skirts &amp;</p>

<p>Dresses.)</p>

<p>Lands&#8217; End (<a href="http://www.landsend.com">http://www.landsend.com</a>) used a design that had both</p>

<p>product descriptions and departments. (Click on Women&#8217;s, then</p>

<p>Swimwear to see their department page design.)</p>

<p>Finally, Eddie Bauer (<a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com">http://www.eddiebauer.com</a>) combined text lists</p>

<p>of all the products in the department with a toggle to see the</p>

<p>pictures for a gallery. (Click on Women, then Sweaters. Click on View</p>

<p>Photos to see a specific gallery.)</p>

<p>After realizing that there were five basic types, we got very excited</p>

<p>about seeing if the different types made a difference. While we&#8217;d</p>

<p>expect differences between individual sites, it wasn&#8217;t clear that we&#8217;d</p>

<p>see if an entire type of design outperformed others.</p>

<p>After watching people shopping on the sites, we compared their</p>

<p>behaviors. (As with many of our e-commerce studies, these users came</p>

<p>to our facilities with a list of products they wanted to buy. We gave</p>

<p>them the money to make the purchases and told them to purchase as much</p>

<p>on their list as possible. In this particular study, there were 44</p>

<p>users who shopped for a total of 687 products.)</p>

<p>Studying the different designs on apparel and home goods sites turned</p>

<p>out to be a good thing. Out of the 687 shopping expeditions that we</p>

<p>observed, users only used the search engine 22% of the time. That</p>

<p>means that 78% of the time they used the categorization scheme to</p>

<p>locate their desired products.</p>

<p>We found the sites with the standard left-nav design, such</p>

<p>as Macy&#8217;s, actually performed the worst, selling the least</p>

<p>amount of product. Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s design performed the best, with Old</p>

<p>Navy&#8217;s combination design being second.</p>

<p>It turned out, in our study, that the number of pages that a user</p>

<p>visited before they put something into their cart was inversely</p>

<p>proportional to purchasing. The more pages they visited, the less they</p>

<p>bought. (Remember, our users knew exactly what they wanted and were</p>

<p>ready to make a purchase.)</p>

<p>When you look at the number of pages visited before a user put</p>

<p>something into their cart, users who traveled through Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s</p>

<p>design purchased by visiting half the pages than users through Macy&#8217;s</p>

<p>design. Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s design had fewer visits to &#8220;wrong galleries&#8221;&#8211;</p>

<p>galleries that didn&#8217;t contain the user&#8217;s desired content (often</p>

<p>forcing the user to hit the &#8220;back&#8221; button&#8211;a clear sign of a</p>

<p>problem).</p>

<p>If you compare Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s design to Macy&#8217;s, you see some</p>

<p>interesting differences. By just looking at Macy&#8217;s &#8217; &#8220;Women&#8217;s Tops&#8221;</p>

<p>department to Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s &#8220;Women&#8217;s Sweaters&#8221;, you can see that Lands&#8217;</p>

<p>End goes to great length to let people have information they need to</p>

<p>make a decision. They give categories, such as &#8220;Twinsets&#8221;,</p>

<p>&#8220;Cardigans&#8221;, and &#8220;Cashmere&#8221;.</p>

<p>Whereas Macy&#8217;s just lists &#8220;Sweaters&#8221;. Visiting the sweaters gallery</p>

<p>shows every sweater Macy&#8217;s sells, with no distinction between the</p>

<p>types of sweaters or fabrics used. Users have to look at each sweater</p>

<p>to determine if it&#8217;s what they are interested in.</p>

<p>With the Lands&#8217; End design, users could either go straight to a</p>

<p>product that was of interest to them or look at the category&#8217;s gallery</p>

<p>by clicking on a &#8220;View these and more&#8221; link. While a lot of our users</p>

<p>clicked on products, many viewed the gallery before choosing their</p>

<p>product.</p>

<p>The Lands&#8217; End design can serve as a model for other types of</p>

<p>content. We could see job listing databases, news stories, or other</p>

<p>large content repositories using a similar design. For example, we</p>

<p>wonder if  A.G. Edwards&#8217; In Focus story page</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.agedwards.com/public/invedu/infocus">http://www.agedwards.com/public/invedu/infocus</a>) could benefit from</p>

<p>this type of design? We think it might.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;(To be fair, A.G. Edwards has done a great job on the launch of
the new design. We feel a little guilty about picking on one page
out of many -- but it is such a great example of the particular
problem we're talking about. We just hope the great folks at A.G.
Edwards will forgive us.)&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The pictures on Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s department page were helpful sometimes</p>

<p>and ignorable the rest. Seeing a picture of a &#8220;twinset&#8221; helps identify</p>

<p>what it is, whereas the pictures of &#8220;Fine Gauge Cotton&#8221; and regular</p>

<p>&#8220;Cotton&#8221; could be swapped and nobody would probably notice or care</p>

<p>(except Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s buyers). This means that content that doesn&#8217;t</p>

<p>lend itself to pictures (such as diseases) doesn&#8217;t really need them&#8211;</p>

<p>it&#8217;s not a necessary part of this specific design.</p>

<p>As we study the differences in the designs of these department pages,</p>

<p>we can learn more about how to design information displays that are</p>

<p>more effective to getting users to their desired content.</p>
